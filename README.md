# Google Cloud Custom IAM Role Generator
Helper module to generate an organization-level [custom IAM role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) based on predefined role and permissions inputs.

Currently, to compose a custom role, you must manually select individual permissions. This module allows users create a custom role based on predefined roles, which are regularly maintained by Google product teams.

For this module to be most effective, you'll need to re-run this on a regular basis so that your custom role is kept up-to-date with the latest permissions from predefined roles.

## Compatibility
This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.13.

## Usage
```hcl
module "custom_role" {
  source      = "./custom-role-generator"
  org_id      = var.org_id
  role_id     = "Developer"
  title       = "Custom Developer Role"
  description = "Role for Developers"
  predefined_roles = [
    "roles/compute.instanceAdmin",
    "roles/bigquery.jobUser"
  ]
  additional_permissions = ["serviceusage.quotas.get"]
  excluded_permissions = ["compute.firewalls.create", "compute.firewalls.delete"]
}
```
